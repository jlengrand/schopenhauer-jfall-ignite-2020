## Description of the talk 

The art of being right… online

By Julien Lengrand-Lambert

The art of being right . . . or the art of controversy is a book written by Schopenhauer back in 1831. It describes many ways to win any arguments or debate; the main point to defeat its opponent rather than establish actual truth. As the current world evolves, and more and more discussions come online; the lessons of the book have never been more relevant or applicable (especially given that we have been forced to see each other way less this past year). Complexity has also increased exponentially online, with discussions being open to anyone with a point of view and social media aiming at keeping us ‘online’ creating a bubble effect. This talk will look back at Schopenhauer’s book and apply its learnings to social media. We will recognize some patterns, look at examples, and more importantly how to defuse them. The aim of this talk is of course not to teach you “how to be right”, there is nothing more boring than that! It will, however, help you recognize some of the social media pitfalls, how to avoid them and hopefully help you handle social media with more peace of mind.
